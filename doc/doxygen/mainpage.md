This document describes the FleCSI-SP C++ API.
The [high-level documentation](../../index.html) provides an introduction to the design and usage of the library more suitable to the new reader or developer as well as full examples for context.

\warning This version includes internal interfaces.
Application developers should use only the interfaces documented in the [user API reference](../user/index.html), as there is no guarantee that those that appear only here will remain stable, _e.g._, a type or interface may simply
be removed or changed.
